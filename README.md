1) I will chose microservice-based architecture becuase it has high scalability, and when system grows it has better flexibility and high
   maintainability (assume system in future become big trendy website)

2) NoSql (Becuase nosql databased are easy to horizontally scalabile though sharding like mechanisms when our system grow)

3) I will go with SSR (becuase ssr approch has High SEO that will help visiter could easily find our web page though google search and SSR approch has low initial load time so it will improve use experince)

4) Next Js - frontend (Becuase it support SSR and SSG like mechanisms out of the box, large community of libraries to get things done easily , and have suspend lazy loading like mechanisms out of the box)
   Node Js (express js) - backend - nodejs is great for building microservice-based applications, simplisity

5) Aws - It has large amount of regions to chose so when our website grows we can easity go multi region , It has better pricing when compared to other services
   It has lot of highly scalabile services out of the box (assume about price concerns and high scalability)

6) Scalability - I will contenarize those microservices use kubernates for container occustration, in kubernates we can set how many replicas needed for each deployment artifact, and it has load balancing out of the box and
   it can set to auto scalling so based on demand sysetm can scalle, when it comes to system some microservicesn need to scale high like recommandation microservice. we can scale based on demand
